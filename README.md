# Colour Sorting System

This project is an Arduino-based system that detects objects by colour and sorts them automatically.

## Project Overview
A colour sensor connected to an Arduino detects the colour of an object. Based on the sensor readings, the Arduino processes the data and controls motors to move the object into the correct category.

## Technologies Used
- Arduino
- Colour sensor
- Servo/Motor control
- 
## Key Learning Points
- Interfacing sensors with microcontrollers
- Real-time sensor data processing
- Writing decision logic for automated systems
- Hardware/software integration
